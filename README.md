# Follow-up to the open letter to anyone who is willing to read it

Hello there,

I am more or less still alive; I'm just too damaged psychologically to the point I don't know what is real and what is not real, and I still have suicidal thoughts day in and day out; but that's for the doctors to solve. To be clear, I am still in a shitty situation and I did not have the chance to move out of this.

Please don't expect me to be active anytime soon all the same, as I am really really really not feeling it.

Take care, you people out there, don't end up where I did.

-Naomi
