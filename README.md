# An open letter to anyone who is willing to read it

Hello there,

I may, or may not, be in a shitty situation depending on when you're reading this letter. Hell I could actually be dead by the time you read it, who knows.
You should have no sad thoughts for me, really, because I deserved to be in the shitty situation I am in, more or less.

It's always like this, society actively punishes the weak ones and it also actively rewards the strong ones. I could not be strong, and now I am suffering according to everyone's plans. What was I thinking, when I thought that I could make it out alive from this living hell?

Thing is, I am part of a minority. I am transgender, and also autistic. I cannot function in society. I can't deal with people, they scare me. I am the weirdo, the awkward one, the idiot, the "hiki", the "tranny", the monster. There is no place for people like me, and this is what I faced every single day of my life.

For the better part of my life I tried to hide the "flaws" I had to participate in society regardless and it went "mostly well", but hiding myself under a mask was what actually put me in a bad spot.
I lost people because of this behaviour, and I still am grieving a lot of losses; and there's nothing I can do, now, to make it all up to them. I also lost myself: who am I? I hid behind a mask that was considered "socially acceptable" for so long that I don't know who I am, and I don't know the amount of time I have to answer this question.

And then, things went horribly wrong.
I lost everything because of multiple causes I cannot disclose for privacy concerns; every last bit of stability I had vanished slowly but steadily, and then my house became as hostile as the outside world. Thing is, I am a victim of the people who are supposed to care for me the most, and they never actually realized that, and probably they never will. I can only say, belittling each and every problem I have in relation to myself and the outside world is probably a really good way to make me lose my sanity first and the will to live after that. And it's also ableism towards me.

Alone and with no real possibility of moving on in this ableist shithole I live in, hope is certainly lost. I can't just "move on my own" and "get a job" and stuff like that, as my social anxiety is just too much to be able to do anything in a social context such as an office or whatever the case may be.
I know people thought of me as a very social person, but that was just the mask I was citing earlier. I am very shy, actually, and I am also terrified of people.

I am facing a series of really hard choices that can either help me move on from this really shitty moment, and at worst, kill me for good.
At the time of writing, I am currently trying to plan out an escape route that involves running away from my city with just a backpack and whatever I can put on it, hoping for the best when I get to that.
To be totally clear, the only other choice is to continue being a hopeless victim until this ultimately kills me in some way.
I know one thing of myself, and it's the need to plan out this kind of stuff very carefully; for this one thing, I actually am planning very little, and this scares me a lot... but I mean, if I fail at least I tried, right?

So, why am I posting this letter in my profile's about section? Well, I had to inform you all that:
- There's no reason to open issue tickets. I am not in a position to do anything anymore.
- There'll be no more commits. Again, I am not in a position to do anything anymore.
- My repositories are to be considered "archives of things I did in the past, just as a coping mechanism to hide from the unspeakable truth of my failure".

Also, I just hope that putting this letter out in the public actually does change things for someone, someone who can still be saved, someone like me... because people like me don't deserve to be called weirdos, or to be hated for what they are, or to be judged, or to be excluded from society. People just have to be nice to one another; why is this so difficult to achieve?

Again, as I was saying at the beginning of this letter, please have no sad thoughts for me as I don't deserve them. I could've been somewhere else, living a totally happy life but I didn't have the guts to do anything for me prior to now.

Also, don't try to contact me, because I don't even know how to respond to any kind of concerns at this point. I don't even know if I could still respond to anything, after all.

Well, for what it's worth, goodbye.

-Naomi
